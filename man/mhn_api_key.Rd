\description{
The API wrapper functions in this package all rely on a MHN server API
key residing in the environment variable \code{MHN_API_KEY} or being
passed in as a parameter. The former is useful in simple deplpoyments
where there is only one MHN server. In such cases, the easiest way to
accomplish this is to set it in the `.Renviron` file in your
home directory.
