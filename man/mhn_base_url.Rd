\description{
The API wrapper functions in this package all rely on acess to an MHN
API server. Ths URL for the server is expected to be specified in
the environment variable \code{MHN_BASE_URL} or being
passed in as a parameter. The former is useful in simple deplpoyments
where there is only one MHN server. In such cases, the easiest way to
accomplish this is to set it in the `.Renviron` file in your
home directory.
