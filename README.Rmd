mhn is an R package to interface with the MHN API and (eventually) provide tools to analyze and visualize MHN data.

The API wrapper functions in this package all rely on a MHN server API
key residing in the environment variable `MHN_API_KEY` or being
passed in as a parameter. The former is useful in simple deplpoyments
where there is only one MHN server. In such cases, the easiest way to 
accomplish this is to set it in the `.Renviron` file in your
home directory.

This package pairs nicely with:
- [iptools](https://github.com/hrbrmstr/iptools)
- [urltools](https://github.com/Ironholds/urltools)
- [cymruservices](https://github.com/hrbrmstr/cymruservices)
- [shodan](https://github.com/hrbrmstr/shodan)
- [rgeolocate](https://github.com/Ironholds/rgeolocate)
- [whoisxmlapi](https://github.com/hrbrmstr/whoisxmlapi)
- [domaintools](https://github.com/hrbrmstr/domaintools)
- [whoapi](https://github.com/Ironholds/whoapi)

The following functions are implemented:

- `attacker_stats`:	Get attacker (IP) statistics
- `feed_info`:	Get data for a specific hpfeed
- `hp_feeds`:	Getthe raw hpfeeds data collected over a specific channel.
- `intel_feed`:	Get intel feed
- `mhn_api_key`:	Get or set `MHN_API_KEY` value
- `sensors`:	Get sensors.
- `sessions`:	Get normalized sessions/connection data
- `session_info`:	Get data for a specific attack session
- `top_attackers`:	Get top attackers
- `mhn_dork`:	MHN dork _(I have no idea what this is tho)_
- `mhn_file`:	MHN file _(I have no idea what this is tho)_
- `mhn_url`:	MHN url _(I have no idea what this is tho)_
